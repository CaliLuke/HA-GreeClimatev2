feat: Refactor core logic, fix tests, update config flow & release scripts

This commit includes significant refactoring, fixes, and process improvements:

- Refactored climate state management and feature detection logic into a new `climate_helpers.py` module.
- Refactored `device_api.py` methods and associated tests (`tests/device_api/`) to use `async`/`await`.
- Updated Config Flow (`config_flow.py`) with fixes and added optional external temperature sensor selector.
- Restructured test directories, moving command tests to `tests/commands/`.
- Fixed various test failures, including correcting exception handling expectations in `device_api` tests.
- Added `mdi:air-conditioner` icon to `manifest.json`.
- Added `prerelease.sh` and significantly updated `release.sh` to streamline the release workflow.
