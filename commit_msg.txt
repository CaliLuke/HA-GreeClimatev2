fix: Allow empty external temp sensor in config flow

Changes the default value for the optional external temperature
sensor field in the user config flow schema from an empty string
to None. This aims to resolve a UI validation error where leaving
the optional field blank was incorrectly treated as an invalid
entity ID.
