## Decision

*   [2025-04-01 17:54:50] Initialize Memory Bank for the project.

## Rationale

*   Maintain project context, track progress, log decisions, and facilitate collaboration between modes.

## Implementation Details

*   Created `memory-bank/` directory with `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`, `decisionLog.md`, `systemPatterns.md`.
*   Populated files with initial structure and relevant context based on the current task and project files.

## Decision

*   [2025-04-01 17:54:50] Prioritize updating `homeassistant` dependency before analyzing/fixing tests.

## Rationale

*   Outdated dependencies are a likely cause of test failures or incompatibilities. Updating first ensures tests are run against the target environment.

## Implementation Details

*   Plan to identify the latest `homeassistant` version.
*   Update `requirements_test.txt`.
*   Use `uv pip install -r requirements_test.txt` to update the environment.

## Decision

*   [2025-04-01 18:36:58] Fix `AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'get'` in `climate.py`'s `SyncState` method.

## Rationale

*   The `GreeGetValues` method (called by `SyncState`) was returning a list of status values from the API, but the subsequent code in `SyncState` was attempting to access this list using dictionary methods (`.get()`), causing the error reported in the logs.

## Implementation Details

*   Modified the `try...else` block within `SyncState` (around lines 1229-1283) in `custom_components/greev2/climate.py`.
*   Added validation to check if `GreeGetValues` returns a list of the expected length.
*   If valid, the list of values (`received_data_list`) is now correctly passed along with the list of property names (`self._optionsToFetch`) to the `SetAcOptions` method, which handles updating the internal state (`self._acOptions`).
*   Improved error handling for connection issues and unexpected data formats.
