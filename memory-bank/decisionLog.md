## Decision

*   [2025-04-01 17:54:50] Prioritize updating `homeassistant` dependency before analyzing/fixing tests.

## Rationale

*   Outdated dependencies are a likely cause of test failures or incompatibilities. Updating first ensures tests are run against the target environment.

## Implementation Details

*   Plan to identify the latest `homeassistant` version.
*   Update `requirements_test.txt`.
*   Use `uv pip install -r requirements_test.txt` to update the environment.
